Josh Clifford looked at the minuscule kettle in his hands and felt stressed.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his urban surroundings. He had always loved crowded Liverpool with its zealous, zesty zoos. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Mavis Ball. Mavis was a snooty coward with brunette abs and ruddy spots.

Josh gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an admirable, malicious, beer drinker with pink abs and red spots. His friends saw him as a decaying, disgusted do gooder. Once, he had even saved a moaning chicken that was stuck in a drain.

But not even an admirable person who had once saved a moaning chicken that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Mavis had in store today.

The clouds danced like jumping bears, making Josh relaxed.

As Josh stepped outside and Mavis came closer, he could see the unusual glint in her eye.

"I am here because I want Internet access," Mavis bellowed, in a tight-fisted tone. She slammed her fist against Josh's chest, with the force of 3951 goldfish. "I frigging love you, Josh Clifford."

Josh looked back, even more relaxed and still fingering the minuscule kettle. "Mavis, beam me up Scotty," he replied.

They looked at each other with delighted feelings, like two melted, mouldy maggots skipping at a very cowardly Valentine's meal, which had orchestral music playing in the background and two greedy uncles jumping to the beat.

Suddenly, Mavis lunged forward and tried to punch Josh in the face. Quickly, Josh grabbed the minuscule kettle and brought it down on Mavis's skull.

Mavis's brunette abs trembled and her ruddy spots wobbled. She looked barmy, her body raw like a bloody, bumpy blade.

Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Mavis Ball was dead.

Josh Clifford went back inside and made himself a nice drink of beer.

As Josh got himself a drink, he became worried. He had just killed Mavis. It
was in self-defense, but no one was around to witness Mavis attacking him. And
now his favorite kettle was dented! He also wondered about Mavis asking for
internet access. Was that just a ploy to distract him? Or did she really just
want to use the internet and ended up getting offended by Josh's decaying,
disgusted, malicious, do-gooder appearance?
